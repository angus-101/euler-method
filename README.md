# euler-method
2nd year computational physics exercise

I used the Euler method to simluate a free falling body, and compared these results with the analytical prediction. The effect of the timestep used on the accuracy was investigated. Then the 'modified Euler method' was implemented and the results from this were compared to the regular Euler method.
